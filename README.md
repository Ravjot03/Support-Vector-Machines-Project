# Support-Vector-Machines-Project

## Support Vector Machines Classifier using Scikit-learn in Python
### Basic info :
In this project, I build a Support Vector Machines classifier to classify a Pulsar star. I have used the predicting a Pulsar Star dataset for this project. I have downloaded this dataset from the Kaggle website.

### Dataset: 
The data can be downloaded from Kaggle. Also you can download it from the repository.

### Table of Contents:
  1. Importing the libraries
  2. Importing dataset
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis
  4. Visualization Part
  5. Machine Learning Algorithm implementation part
  6. Visualization of output
